A stream has no concept of an index of the read or writes data, like an array does. 
Nor can you typically move forth and back in a stream, like you can in an array, or in a file using RandomAccessFile. 
A stream is just a continuous flow of data. Java IO streams are typically either byte based or character based. 
The streams that are byte based are typically called something with "stream", like InputStream or OutputStream. 
These streams read and write a raw byte at a time, with the exception of the DataInputStream and DataOutputStream which can also read and write int, long, float and double values. 
The streams that are character based are typically called something with "Reader" or "Writer". 
The character based streams can read / write characters (like Latin1 or UNICODE characters).
